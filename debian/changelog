  * Kill running gvfs instance after tests finish. Because the
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was changed to be in the build-tree, a running gvfs
    instance held a lock on a file in the directory, preventing it from
    being cleaned properly, and preventing the build from finishing. So
    we send a SIGTERM to the running gvfs-fused instance, allowing the
    build to finish.
  * Use accountsservice and make work under unity-greeter.
  * Proper shutdown on SIGTERM.
